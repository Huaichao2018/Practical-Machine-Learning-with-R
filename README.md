# Practical Machine Learning with R by Packt
Understand how machine learning works and get hands-on experience of using R to build algorithms that can solve various real-world problems 

## What you will learn
* Define a problem that can be solved by training a machine learning model
* Obtain, verify and clean data before transforming it into the correct format for use
* Perform exploratory analysis and extract features from data
* Build models for neural net, linear and non-linear regression, classification, and clustering
* Evaluate the performance of a model with the right metrics
* Implement a classification problem using the neural net package
* Employ a decision tree using the random forest library




### Hardware requirements
For an optimal student experience, we recommend the following hardware configuration:
* **Processor**: Intel Core i5 or equivalent
* **Memory**: 4GB RAM or more
* **Hard disk**: 40GB or more
* Stable Internet connection



### Software requirements
You'll also need the following software installed in advance:
* **OS**: Windows 7 SP1 64-bit, Windows 8.1 64-bit or Windows 10 64-bit, Ubuntu Linux, or the latest
version of macOS
* Browser: Google Chrome/Mozilla Firefox Latest Version
* R installed
* R libraries as needed (mice,caret,rpart,groupdata2,cvms,neuralnet,NeuralNetTools,rPref,mlbench,knitr,interplot, and so)


**The following Python libraries are needed**:
* R
* Cross validation
* Deep Learning
* Machine Learning
* Logistic Regression Model
* Advanced modeling stratergies
